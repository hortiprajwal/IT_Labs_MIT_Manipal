select * from user_tables;

select table_name;

i. Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys and the foreign
keys.

create table PERSON (
	driver_id varchar(30), 
	name varchar(50), 
	Address varchar(100),
	primary key (driver_id) );

create table CAR (
	regno varchar(20), 
	model varchar(30), 
	Year int,
	primary key (regno) );

create table ACCIDENT (
	report_number int, 
	accd_date date, 
	location varchar(50),
	primary key (report_number) );

create table OWNS (
	driver_id varchar(30), 
	regno varchar(20),
	foreign key (driver_id) references PERSON,
	foreign key (regno) references CAR );

create table PARTICIPATED (
	driver_id varchar(30), 
	regno varchar(20), 
	report_number int, 
	damage_amount int,
	foreign key (driver_id) references PERSON,
	foreign key (regno) references CAR,
	foreign key (report_number) references ACCIDENT );

ii. Enter at least five tuples for each relation

//PERSON
insert into PERSON values('1','Pandu','Manipal');
insert into PERSON values('2','Ramu','Mumbai');
insert into PERSON values('3','Lucky','Pune');

insert into CAR values('103','Aston Martin','2021');
insert into CAR values('104','Tesla','2017');
insert into CAR values('105','Rolls-Royce','2018');

//ACCIDENT
insert into Accident values(1001,to_date('22-11-2019','dd-mm-yyyy'),'Manipal');

insert into OWNS values('3','102');
insert into OWNS values('4','103');
insert into OWNS values('5','104');

insert into PARTICIPATED values('5','104',1005,18000);
insert into PARTICIPATED values('6','105',1006,50000);

iii. Update the damage amount to 25000 for the car with a specific reg. no in a
PARTICIPATED table with report number 12.

update PARTICIPATED 
set damage_amount=25000
where driver_id='3'; //used report_number=3 instead of 12 as there was no such tuple.


iv. Delete the accident and related information that took place in a specific year. 
(Hint: Command to extract year component from the date attribute is,
extract (year from accd_date) )

delete from ACCIDENT 
where extract(year from accd_date)=2021 
and report_number=1006;

v. Alter table to add and delete an attribute

alter table car 
add colour varchar(50);

alter table car
drop column colour;


vi. Alter table to add Check constraint.

alter table ACCIDENT 
add check (report_number>=1000);//check constraint for report_number>=1000

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_PersonAge CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes');//for multiple columns

Lab-4
1. Find the total number of people who owned cars that were involved in accidents in
2008.

select count(distinct driver_id) from participated 
natural join accident where extract (year from accd_date) = '2018';

2. Find the number of accidents in which cars belonging to a specific model were
involved.

select count(report_number) from accident NATURAL JOIN participated 
NATURAL JOIN CAR where car.model = 'Tesla';


3. Produce a listing with header as OWNER_NAME, No. of Accidents, and Total
Damage Amount in a descending order on total damage.

select PERSON.name as Owner_Name, count(report_number) as No_of_Accidents, sum(damage_amount) as Total_Amount 
from PERSON NATURAL JOIN PARTICIPATED group by PERSON.name;

4. List the Owners who made more than 2 accidents in a year.

select driver_id from PARTICIPATED 
NATURAL JOIN ACCIDENT where extract(year from accd_date) = '2019' 
having count(report_number)>1 group by driver_id;

5. List the owners who are not involved in any accident.

(select name from PERSON) minus (select name from PERSON natural join PARTICIPATED);
